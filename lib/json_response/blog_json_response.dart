//             "short_description": "Plant-based diets can dramatically change your world. Learn how it is possible.",
//             "description": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Nowadays, people are more focused on consuming a healthy diet, such as our greens! The benefits of using plant-based foods include better health, environmental conservation, and protection of animals. Because plants contain a lot of fiber, antioxidants, and vitamins, you might reduce the chance of getting diabetes, heart disease, and other types of cancer. Besides, you will also be helping the environment by lowering your carbon footprint, saving water, and not participating in activities that may be dreadful to animals. Nevertheless, based on your curiosity or not, it is evident that adopting a plant-based diet will lead to a better environment.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Changing to a partial, or even complete, plant-based diet helps lessen the negative impacts of chronic diseases and subsequently has a smaller ecological impact on food production. Incorporating plant-based diets is also justified by ethical imperatives, as avoiding industrial animal production is frequently associated with animal abuse and poor housing conditions.</span></p><h2>Health Benefits</h2><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Some of the potential health benefits of using a traditional plant-based diet include:</span></p><h3>Reduced risk of chronic diseases</h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Changing to a plant-based diet has reduced the chances of contracting various diseases. Plant-based foods are derived from plants and are in their most natural state. This implies they haven't been heavily processed and aren't loaded with chemicals and additives with little to no nutritional value.</span></p><h3>Heart Disease</h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">There is evidence that plant food consumption reduces cholesterol and blood pressure, both of which are major risks for heart disease.</span></p><h3>The fiber content in plants</h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The high fiber content in plants regulates blood cholesterol levels in the body, and the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory contents in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds promote cardiovascular health.</span></p><h3>High Blood Pressure</h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Potassium and magnesium, present in many foods of plant origin, contribute to normalizing hypertension. Health-conscious individuals should add essential minerals, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains since these help regulate and prevent high blood pressure.</span></p><h3>Diabetes</h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Studies have shown that increased plant-based diets improve blood sugar regulation and increase insulin sensitivity in the body. This can truly help to prevent type 2 diabetes. Fiber-rich foods, including whole grains, legumes, and many vegetables, cause sugar to enter your system more gradually. By preventing unpleasant spikes, this gradual release aids in maintaining stable blood sugar levels.</span></p><h2>Environmental Benefits</h2><h3>Reduced Carbon Footprint</h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Animal farming is among the sectors that contribute substantially to the production of greenhouse gases and is globally recognized to be a pivotal culprit behind climate change.</span></p><h3>Conservation of Water Resources</h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The genetic fabrication of plant-based foods usually requires significantly less water than what is used to feed animals that society feeds on. For instance, in terms of volume, the water needed to support agriculture, such as farming vegetables, grains, or legumes, is still much lower than the water required to support livestock.</span></p><h3>Reduced Deforestation</h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Consuming fewer animal products should solve the problem as it will decrease the need to use forests for pastures. One of the primary uses of forests involves chopping down trees and converting the land into an area for raising animals or growing fodder crops for them. Increased plant-based food consumption reduces the need for these operations, which protects biodiversity and essential forest ecosystems. This preserves innumerable species' habitats and upholds the world's ecological balance.</span></p><h3>Sustainable Food System</h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Nutritious food from plant sources is eco-friendly and can feed the world population much better than foods acquired from animal farming. Intensive animal farming is also costly in terms of feed, water, and space resources used in rearing animals.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">However, compared to animal farming, plant agriculture is comparatively more efficient in producing the same amount of food using the available resources. Rapid and effective population growth feeding could contribute to global food security without accelerating environmental deterioration. One way people can contribute to developing a more equitable and sustainable global food system is by consuming fewer animal products.</span></p><h2>Transitional Advice</h2><h3>Proceed Gently</h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Start by substituting progressively plant-based items for animal products, one meal at a time, or one animal product at a time in the present diet. This could entail moving from animal proteins, like meat, to plant proteins from sources like tofu, tempeh, or beans or from cow's milk to almond or oat milk. In this manner, your palates and eating habits can gradually change rather than suddenly shifting to a greater proportion of plant-based foods.</span></p><h3>Discover New Foods</h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The interesting selection of different foods is one of the best things about the shift to a plant-based diet. Try experimenting with a broader range of fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes to learn more about their potential tastes and structural makeup. It is also possible to try out new diets that feature a variety of meals from other nations; Middle Eastern, Indian, and Mediterranean cuisines are excellent examples since they typically have a large number of vegetarian dishes. Try everything to improve your diet, and make the process interesting. </span></p><h3>Learn for Yourself</h3><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">When consuming plant-based foods, one must have some nutritional awareness to ensure their intake is well-balanced and free of animal ingredients. Make an effort to commit to memory of the essential nutrients and the plant-based foods that provide them. Maybe talk to your doctor about it, read books, visit other trustworthy websites, or, better yet, consult a nutritionist to gain a thorough understanding of proper nutrition. With the right knowledge, you may improve your chances of success by modifying your eating habits and following a more balanced diet to achieve this aim.</span></p><h2>Last Words</h2><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">People can significantly contribute to improving their health, safeguarding the environment, and encouraging the humane treatment of animals by switching to a plant-based diet. This dietary adjustment dramatically reduces the environmental impact of food production and confers enormous health benefits by lowering the risk of chronic diseases. Plant-based diets lower greenhouse gas emissions, stop deforestation and preserve essential water supplies. </span></p>",

Its high fiber content has led to its usage in animal feed in various places across the world for animals such as buffaloes, cattle, goats, and sheep. There is a great deal of potential for rice straw to be used to produce bioenergy. Large quantities of rice straw are generated globally (annual production 731 million tons).To mill one kilogram of rice, around 0.7–1.4 kg of rice straw is generated. Straws have a protein content of 3 to 5%, Rice straw contains higher quantities of potassium (1.58% of DM), calcium (0.53%), and magnesium (0.24%). But it is low in phosphorus (0.12%), sodium (0.13%), iron (0.07%), and manganese (0.07%).</span></p><h2>Rice Husks:</h2><p style=\"text-align: center; \"><img src=\"https://www.glucorp.com/filemanager/photos/13/blog/Facts about rich 2.jpg\" style=\"width: 601.199px; height: 337px;\"></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">In addition to being bulky, rice husk also contains As a matter of fact, discarded rice husks make up roughly 20% of a rice paddy harvest. Rice husk is composed of approximately 40% cellulose, 30% lignin, and 20% silica. Outer protective coverings of rice grains are called rice husks. These husks are removed from the grains during milling. It comprises between 30 and 50 percent of organic carbon and is widely accessible in all rice-producing nations. When it comes to sustainability, rice husk has a lot of potentials. It may be used to make solid fuel in the form of briquettes or pellets, as well as the leftover carbonized rice husk that is left after combustion. Building materials can be strengthened using it because of its high silica content. In addition, it is resistant to the growth of Moisture cannot penetrate it. It takes a long time for it to dissipate. In addition, it is very insulating. It is a renewable resource. A soil amendment, an additive in cement and steel, brick manufacturing, steam engines and gasifiers that power rice mills, even rice dryers may utilize rice husk ash as a source of heat. Rice husk ash has a high silica concentration, which makes it an excellent addition for the steel and concrete industries It's also utilized as a soil conditioner, activated carbon, and insulator. The production of rice husks is about 100 million tons per year. For many years in China, rice husk has been utilized as an insulating material in cold storage, and it is readily available.</span></p><h2>Rice Bran:</h2><p style=\"text-align: center; \"><img src=\"https://www.glucorp.com/filemanager/photos/13/blog/Facts about rich 3.jpg\" style=\"width: 600.613px; height: 321px;\"></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">As a result of the rice milling process, rice bran is one of the primary byproducts When brown rice is milled, it is removed from the exterior brown coating. 63 million tonnes of rice bran are manufactured each year across the globe.

It is an excellent source of proteins and lipids as well as carbs, y-oryzanol, and saturated fat. It was shown through research that dietary rice bran fortification might reduce diarrhea in a variety of conditions, including IBS, human rotavirus infection, and human norovirus infection. A component found in rice bran oil may effectively lessen cholesterol by decreasing cholesterol absorption and increasing cholesterol excretion. When calcium absorption is reduced, some forms of kidney stones may be less likely to develop. By dewaxing rice oil in a cold compress, rice bran wax is produced. It's a yellowish, firm natural wax with high thermal conductivity.</span></p><h2>Other Rice products: </h2><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Some of the <a href=\"https://www.glucorp.com/product\">products</a> are directly created from rice.</span></p><h3>Maltodextrin: </h3><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">It is a white powder that is produced from a variety of sources, Despite the fact that it's derived from organic, it's First, the starches are boiled, next acids or enzymes like high-temperature bacterial alpha-amylase are given to more divide.</span></p><h3>Rice Starch: </h3><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Starch made from rice is commonly used in the production of baby formula as a thickening agent.

Honey - A Straightforward Comparision Between The Two</h2><p style=\"text-align: center; \"><img src=\"https://www.glucorp.com/filemanager/photos/13/blog/Brown Rice Syrup Vs. Honey 3.jpg\" style=\"width: 700.692px; height: 393.734px;\"></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><a href=\"https://www.glucorp.com/blog/food-production-methods\">Organic food types always weigh superior to contemporary processed foods</a>. It is not just a say, but many supportive arguments have been laid and discussed over the years. Likewise, brown sugar syrup and honey need a consummative approach to deal with.</span></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><a href=\"https://www.glucorp.com/product/organic-brown-rice-syrup\" target=\"_blank\">Brown rice syrups</a> and honey, though the sweeteners own a lot of differences. Let’s just unveil the differentials to conclude which one goes well with the healthy lifestyle setting.</span></p><h2>Let’s Start With Something Purely Basic - The Origin</h2><p style=\"text-align: center; \">&nbsp;<img src=\"https://www.glucorp.com/filemanager/photos/13/blog/Brown Rice Syrup Vs. Honey 2.jpg\" style=\"width: 701.031px; height: 493.702px;\"></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Brown rice syrup or maple <a href=\"https://www.glucorp.com/product/organic-brown-rice-syrup\">rice syrup is produced by treating the brown rice</a> with certain enzymes that aid the breakdown of starch into simple sugars, filtering out the impurities. The process then provides us with a thicker syrup with a consistency majorly relatable to honey.</span></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">On the other hand, honey has a natural extraction process primarily. Bees are not just essential for keeping our world pollinated, but they are the source of delicious honey.</span></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The bees extract the nectar from the flowers and keep it in their honey stomach, an accessory stomach of the bees. Then in the nest, they pass the nectars to the other bees.</span></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Bees chew it until the viscosity of the honey form is attained. They now store the honey in their honeycombs, which the man later achieves technically for the purpose of packaging,&nbsp; storage, and supply.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Caloric Intake is Major Concern</h2><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Brown rice syrup contains maltotriose (52%), maltose (45%), and glucose (3%) that eventually serves to be a full-blown glucose ingredient in our body. It contains trace elements that are too meager to benefit a daily user.</span></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">A 1 tablespoon of honey contains 64 calories, 11mg of potassium, 17g of carbohydrates (sugar), and a trace amount of vitamins and minerals.</span></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">It also contains anti-oxidants, precisely polyphenols, that are known to lower the risk of many systemic and cardiac diseases. Also, anti-oxidants have a known role in keeping your cells off from mutations, hence preventing one from acquiring cancer. Isn’t this great news?</span></p><h2>Glycemic Index - The Point To Be Noted</h2><p style=\"text-align: center; \">&nbsp;<img src=\"https://www.glucorp.com/filemanager/photos/13/blog/Brown Rice Syrup Vs. Honey 1.jpg\" style=\"width: 700.078px; height: 465.856px;\"></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Honey has a relatively low glycemic load of 10 and a glycemic index of 58, which surely sets it in a better position when compared to 98 GI of brown <a href=\"https://www.glucorp.com/product-list/rice-syrups\" target=\"_blank\">rice syrup</a>.</span></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Glycemic index is the measure of how quickly a food can raise the body’s blood sugar. Foods with higher GI are a known risk factor for obesity, which may give rise to diabetes, heart diseases, stroke, bone disease, and body pain.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Who is the Winner?</h2><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Of course, it’s the honey. Since the organic preparation mode lowers carbohydrates and glycemic value to the presence of antioxidants, honey is always found ahead in the race.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Overall Health Benefits of Honey</h2><p style=\"text-align: center; \">&nbsp;<img src=\"https://www.glucorp.com/filemanager/photos/13/blog/Brown Rice Syrup Vs. Honey.jpg\" style=\"width: 700.999px; height: 466.469px;\"></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Here you go with an explanatory list of the benefits associated linked with the use of honey.</span></p><ol><li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Honey may help lower triglycerides and fats in the body. This is certainly going to help one reduce weight by improving the overall lipid profile of the body.</span></li><li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Honey adds zinc and copper to the body. It helps boost the immune system, which improves the functionality of the nervous and digestive systems.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">It contains multiple antioxidants that reduce the risk for certain forms of cancer.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">It is also used to treat a lot of ailments. In ancient days, it was used as a topical preparation for wounds.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Honey is also a valid treatment for sore throat and pharyngitis.&nbsp;</span></li></ol><h2>Health Risks Associated With Brown Rice Syrup</h2><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Brown rice contains arsenic that poses a serious health risk to regular users. This, in turn, gives rise to ailments that can chronically progress to morbidities and mortalities. Now it’s you to decide which of the two is good for you.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Is Honey a better Substitute for Brown Rice Syrup in a Diabetic Patient?</h2><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Well, honey is 60% fructose and 40% glucose, so it has more fructose. The rationale that people mainly use is that fructose is fruit sugar and better comply with the sugar needs in a diabetic patient. It has a glycemic index of 58 which is comparatively lower than that of brown rice syrup. Fructose is metabolized by the liver, so it does create insulin resistance which is, therefore, not better to opt for a patient with lower insulin levels already.</span></p><h2>Final Verdict</h2><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Summarizing all the facts and figures stated above in the table below.&nbsp; </span></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Hence, it is concluded that honey is the better option when compared to brown rice syrup.

This is due to the amount of magnesium it contains.</span></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Being enriched with numerous vitamins does bring it into consideration. Yet, the majority of the athletes dislike drinking it, and even the health specialist recommends keeping away from the diary.</span></p><p style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The excessive lactose it contains indeed lowers its value, and the surfeit calories it offers merely do the opposite of what one wants.
